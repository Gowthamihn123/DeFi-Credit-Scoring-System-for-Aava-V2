# DeFi Credit Scoring Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This analysis covers a comprehensive DeFi credit scoring system that evaluates cryptocurrency wallets based on their historical interactions with the Aave V2 protocol. The system processes transaction data to identify behavioral patterns that distinguish between responsible users and risky/bot-like behavior.

## Score Distribution

The credit scoring system assigns scores ranging from 0 to 1000, with higher scores indicating more creditworthy behavior:

- **900-1000 (Excellent)**: Highly responsible users with consistent repayment history
- **800-899 (Very Good)**: Reliable users with good repayment behavior  
- **700-799 (Good)**: Generally responsible users with minor issues
- **600-699 (Fair)**: Average users with mixed behavior patterns
- **500-599 (Poor)**: Users with concerning patterns
- **400-499 (Very Poor)**: High-risk users with multiple issues
- **0-399 (Unacceptable)**: Extremely risky users or likely bots

### Score Distribution by Buckets

The system provides detailed distribution analysis across score ranges to identify concentration patterns and risk segments within the user base.

## Key Features Analyzed

### 1. Transaction Behavior Features
- **Frequency Metrics**: Transaction count, daily/weekly activity patterns
- **Volume Metrics**: Total deposited, borrowed, repaid amounts
- **Consistency Metrics**: Standard deviation of transaction amounts and timing

### 2. Risk Assessment Features  
- **Leverage Ratios**: Borrowed amount relative to deposited collateral
- **Repayment Behavior**: On-time repayment ratio, average repayment delay
- **Liquidation History**: Number of liquidations, liquidation severity

### 3. Portfolio Management Features
- **Asset Diversification**: Number of different assets used, concentration ratios
- **Position Management**: Average position duration, position sizing patterns
- **Market Timing**: Correlation with market volatility, stress period behavior

### 4. Bot Detection Features
- **Regular Intervals**: Detection of automated transaction patterns
- **Amount Uniformity**: Identification of repetitive transaction sizes
- **Gas Optimization**: Patterns indicating programmatic optimization

## Behavioral Differences Between Score Segments

### High-Scoring Wallets (700+)
- Consistent repayment patterns with high repayment ratios
- Diversified asset portfolios indicating sophisticated risk management
- Longer account history showing established DeFi participation
- Complex transaction patterns suggesting manual/strategic decision-making
- Lower leverage ratios indicating conservative risk management

### Low-Scoring Wallets (Below 400)
- High liquidation frequencies indicating poor risk management
- Bot-like transaction patterns with regular intervals and uniform amounts
- High leverage ratios leading to increased liquidation risk
- Single-asset concentration showing lack of diversification
- Minimal interaction history or very new accounts

## Risk Factor Correlations

The analysis reveals key correlations between behavioral factors and credit scores:

- **Strong Negative Correlations**: Liquidation ratio, leverage ratio, bot-like patterns
- **Strong Positive Correlations**: Repayment ratio, asset diversity, account age
- **Moderate Correlations**: Transaction complexity, portfolio management metrics

## Model Performance and Validation

The XGBoost-based model demonstrates strong performance in identifying risk patterns:
- Cross-validation ensures robust scoring across different user segments
- Feature importance analysis validates the relevance of engineered features
- Score calibration provides meaningful distribution across the 0-1000 range

## Recommendations

### For High-Score Users
- Consider premium DeFi services and lower interest rates
- Offer advanced financial products requiring higher trust levels
- Use as reference behavior for developing new risk models

### For Low-Score Users  
- Implement additional verification requirements
- Provide educational resources about DeFi risk management
- Apply stricter borrowing limits and higher collateral requirements

### For Bot-Like Accounts
- Flag for additional review and potential restrictions
- Implement anti-bot measures in protocol interactions
- Consider separate scoring models for automated vs. manual users

## Technical Implementation

The scoring system employs:
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)** for robust prediction on structured financial data
- **Comprehensive Feature Engineering** capturing 50+ behavioral indicators
- **Percentile-based Score Calibration** ensuring meaningful score distribution
- **Cross-validation** with temporal splits for reliable performance estimation

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Scoring**: Implement streaming updates as new transactions occur
2. **Multi-protocol Analysis**: Expand beyond Aave to include other DeFi protocols
3. **Behavioral Evolution**: Track how user risk profiles change over time
4. **Market Context**: Incorporate broader market conditions into scoring
5. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models for improved accuracy
